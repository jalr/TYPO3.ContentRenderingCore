Frequently asked questions
==========================

- **Q**: I don't see all the backend fields I can use for the configuration of a content element.

  **A**: When you are coming from css_styled_content, there is a difference in the availability of fields,
  but also the ordering and placement in tabs. We have removed some fields which are not suitable for an editor or can
  be done by using CSS. See :ref:`behaviour-and-styles` on how to do this.
